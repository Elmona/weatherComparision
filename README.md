# Assignment 3 - Final Project

By Anton Strand (as224xs) and Emil Larsson (el223nc)

## Tasks

### 1. Idea

We chose to create a "Compare weather" app. The user is able to compare the weather between two cities during a specified time limit.

This application is directed to people who are either looking for a place to spend there holiday or perhaps even looking for a new city to move to. By be able to compare the weather between two cities the decision to where could be easier to make.

This is just a prototype so the number of cities will be limited. The main functionality will be to be able to compare the average temperature and rain count between two cities during the time span specified by the user.

The data will be imported from SMHI.

### 2. Logical model

Rain station and temperature station can be two different stations.

### 3. Design in SQL

### 4. SQL queries

### 5. Implementation

### 6. Supplemental video
